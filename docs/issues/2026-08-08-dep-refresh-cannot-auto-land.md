# Weekly dep-refresh cannot fully auto-land: branches accumulate and are never deleted

## Agent Index

- **Kind:** issue
- **Status:** active
- **Level:** I1
- **Last verified:** 2026-08-08
- **Resolution:** Open
- **Severity:** Low - branch-list noise only; dependency updates are landing
- **Affected version:** `.github/workflows/dep-refresh.yml` at commit `d0c2cc6`
- **Read when:** hardening `dep-refresh.yml`, changing repo merge settings, or
  investigating stray `dep-refresh/*` branches.
- **Search terms:** dep-refresh, stray branches, delete_branch_on_merge,
  auto-merge, branch accumulation, dated branch name.
- **Relates to:** pdomain-ui `docs/specs/2026-07-16-dep-refresh-auto-land-design.md`
  (different repository, cited as the authority for the fix; read-only here).

## Summary

**The weekly `dep-refresh` workflow opens a new dated branch every run and
never deletes it, so branches accumulate.** As of 2026-08-08 there are 7 stray
`dep-refresh/*` branches on `origin` and 0 open pull requests. Dependency
updates are landing: the three most recent scheduled runs (2026-07-19,
2026-07-26, 2026-08-02) each opened a PR that auto-merged cleanly. The defect
is that neither a merged nor an abandoned run's branch is ever cleaned up, so
the branch list grows without bound.

This repository does **not** have the broken-required-context defect that
`pdomain-ops` and `pdomain-ocr-training` have. Branch protection on `master`
requires exactly two contexts, `static-check` and `test`
(`gh api repos/pdomain/pdomain-index-pip/branches/master/protection --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'` → `["static-check","test"]`), and
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines jobs named exactly `static-check` and
`test` that report those contexts (`app_id: 15368` on both, not `null`). The
required contexts are satisfiable, and current evidence shows they are being
satisfied.

## Impact

- Anyone browsing branches on `pdomain/pdomain-index-pip` sees 7 stale
  `dep-refresh/*` branches with no open PR behind them.
- No functional impact on dependency landing: the auto-merge path works when
  the branch protection gate is satisfiable, and the last three scheduled
  runs merged without human action.
- A milder failure than peers where refresh PRs also pile up **open** and
  unmerged (that is the `pdomain-ops` / `pdomain-ocr-training` pattern, caused
  by a required context that can never be satisfied). Here the pile-up is
  branches only, not open PRs — confirmed by `gh pr list --repo pdomain/pdomain-index-pip --state all --limit 20` returning 0 rows with
  `state: OPEN`.

## Environment / versions

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/dep-refresh.yml`, current at commit `d0c2cc6`
  (`git log --oneline -- .github/workflows/dep-refresh.yml`).
- Repository setting: `delete_branch_on_merge: false`
  (`gh api repos/pdomain/pdomain-index-pip --jq '{delete_branch_on_merge, default_branch}'` → `{"default_branch":"master", "delete_branch_on_merge":false}`).
- Branch protection: `master` requires `["static-check","test"]`, both with
  non-null `app_id: 15368` (`gh api repos/pdomain/pdomain-index-pip/branches/master/protection --jq '.required_status_checks'`).
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines jobs `static-check` (line 15) and
  `test` (line 25) — the exact names branch protection requires.

## Evidence

Observations, verified 2026-08-08 against current source and the GitHub API:

- `.github/workflows/dep-refresh.yml` builds a per-run dated branch name:
  `BRANCH="dep-refresh/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$GITHUB_RUN_ID"`, then always runs
  `git checkout -b "$BRANCH"` and `gh pr create ... --head "$BRANCH"`
  unconditionally — there is no check for an existing open PR before creating
  a new branch.
- `gh api repos/pdomain/pdomain-index-pip/branches?per_page=100 --jq '.[].name'` lists 7 `dep-refresh/*` branches plus `master`:
  `dep-refresh/2026-06-21-27896611011`, `dep-refresh/2026-06-28-28313829985`,
  `dep-refresh/2026-07-05-28731654495`, `dep-refresh/2026-07-12-29181398267`,
  `dep-refresh/2026-07-19-29674926200`, `dep-refresh/2026-07-26-30189720964`,
  `dep-refresh/2026-08-02-30734360326`.
- `gh pr list --repo pdomain/pdomain-index-pip --state all --limit 20` shows 7
  `chore: weekly dep refresh` pull requests (#22–#28), 0 currently open:
  - #26, #27, #28 (weeks of 2026-07-19, 2026-07-26, 2026-08-02): `MERGED`.
    Their branches remain on `origin` only because `delete_branch_on_merge`
    is `false` — auto-merge itself worked.
  - #22, #23, #24, #25 (weeks of 2026-06-21 through 2026-07-12): `CLOSED`
    with `mergedAt: null`, all closed within the same minute
    (`2026-07-12T10:09:50–51Z`, confirmed via `gh pr view <n> --json state, mergedAt,closedAt`) — a manual batch-close, not an auto-merge. This
    timestamp coincides with the batch-close event the cited pdomain-ui spec
    describes for its own four stuck PRs (`#57`–`#60`, closed
    2026-07-12), consistent with the same red-week cleanup sweep touching
    multiple repos rather than a defect specific to this repo's required
    checks.
- No corresponding defect exists here for what closed #22–#25: this repo's
  required contexts (`static-check`, `test`) are real, reporting checks (see
  Environment / versions), unlike `pdomain-ui`'s `unit-test` context, which
  had `app_id: null` and could never be satisfied. #22–#25 were most likely
  genuinely red dependency-bump weeks with nothing to auto-clean them up, the
  same "Bug 2" failure mode the cited spec describes — not the "Bug 1"
  broken-context failure mode.

## Root-cause hypotheses

1. `dep-refresh.yml` derives its branch name from the run date and run ID
   (`dep-refresh/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$GITHUB_RUN_ID`), so every scheduled run
   creates a brand-new branch instead of reusing one. Confirmed directly from
   the workflow source — no runtime investigation needed.
1. `delete_branch_on_merge` is `false` at the repository level, so even a
   fully successful, auto-merged run leaves its branch behind. Confirmed via
   the GitHub API repo-settings call above.
1. The workflow never checks for an existing open PR before creating a new
   branch/PR, so a red week has no way to be reused by the following week's
   run — each red (or manually closed) week's branch is permanent dead
   weight. Confirmed by reading the "Create branch, commit, and open PR" step,
   which runs unconditionally on `steps.changes.outputs.changed == 'true'`
   with no existing-PR lookup.

## Defects to fix

1. `dep-refresh.yml` names its branch `dep-refresh/<date>-<run-id>`, so no run
   ever reuses a previous run's branch.
1. `delete_branch_on_merge` is `false` on `pdomain/pdomain-index-pip`, so
   merged `dep-refresh` branches are never cleaned up automatically.
1. `dep-refresh.yml` does not check for an existing open PR before creating a
   new branch and PR, so a red week's branch/PR is abandoned rather than
   reused by the next run.

## Next steps

The pdomain-ui spec at `docs/specs/2026-07-16-dep-refresh-auto-land-design.md`
(in the `pdomain-ui` repository, read-only from here) is the design authority
for this fix. Its Design section B and C apply directly to this repo:

1. Replace the dated branch name with one reusable `dep-refresh` branch,
   force-pushed from a fresh `master` on every run (spec Design B).
1. Open a pull request only when no open PR already exists for that branch,
   then re-arm `gh pr merge --auto --rebase` (spec Design B).
1. Set `delete_branch_on_merge: true` on `pdomain/pdomain-index-pip` (spec
   Design C).
1. Note the scope difference from the spec's home repo: this repo does not
   need the spec's Design A (`ci.yml` `unit-test` aggregation job) — its
   required contexts already report correctly. For this repo, enabling
   delete-on-merge alone (step 3) would resolve the currently observed
   symptom (7 stray branches); the reusable-branch change (steps 1–2) is the
   structural fix that also prevents a run of red weeks from piling up
   branches the way #22–#25 did on 2026-07-12.

## Resolution

Open.
