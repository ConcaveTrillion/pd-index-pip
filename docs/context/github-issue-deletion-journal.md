- **Status:** active
- **Level:** I1

## What this records

**This journal is append-only.** It records the permanent deletion of GitHub
issues from `pdomain/pdomain-index-pip` after their content was migrated into
governed documentation. GitHub issue deletion cannot be undone.

Every row was written and pushed **before** the corresponding deletion ran, as
required by the
[migration runbook](../runbooks/github-issues-to-docgraph-migration.md).

- **Actor:** ConcaveTrillion (repository admin)
- **Authorized:** 2026-07-19 by the owner, after all cutover gates passed
- **Merged commit carrying every destination:** `3c9a4df`
- **Organization setting:** `members_can_delete_issues: true`

Former issue URLs all follow
`https://github.com/pdomain/pdomain-index-pip/issues/<N>`.
