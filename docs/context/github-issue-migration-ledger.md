# GitHub issue migration ledger

## Agent Index

- **Kind:** reference
- **Status:** active
- **Level:** I1
- **Last verified:** 2026-07-19
- **Read when:** tracing where a former GitHub issue went, or auditing the
  issue-tracker cutover.
- **Search terms:** migration ledger, GitHub issues, provenance, raw digest,
  deletion status, issue cutover.

## What this records

**This ledger accounts for all 21 GitHub issues that existed on
`pdomain/pdomain-index-pip` before the tracker cutover.** Every issue appears
exactly once. The count matches GitHub's 20 open plus 1 closed at export time on
2026-07-19.

Raw exports were taken with `gh issue view --json` and digested with SHA-256.
They live outside the governed docs tree and are not committed. Re-export and
re-digest before acting on any row.

None of the 21 issues carried comments, so no comment text was lost in
migration.

## Verification changed five classifications

Five issues were labelled `status:backlog` but are already implemented. Each was
verified against current source on 2026-07-19 rather than inferred from issue
state. Issue #21 was checked the same way and is genuinely still open.

## Ledger

| # | Title | State | Outcome | Destination | Evidence | Deleted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–15 | Rename sweep cluster | OPEN | Needs owner decision | [gh-001-015 record](../issues/2026-07-19-gh-001-015-rename-sweep.md) | Plan and spec files absent from `/workspaces`; superseded by the `pdomain-*` rename | No |
| 16 | Document dependency-confusion-safe pip and uv index usage | OPEN | Implemented | [architecture](../architecture/python-release-asset-index.md) line 45 | `README.md:49-63` — `explicit = true`, `tool.uv.sources` per package, warns against unrestricted `--extra-index-url` | No |
| 17 | Fail regen when release asset fetches fail unexpectedly | OPEN | Implemented | [architecture](../architecture/python-release-asset-index.md) | `scripts/regen_index.py:84-86,121-124` — matches repo-not-found narrowly, re-raises otherwise | No |

| 20 | Add tests for simple-index generator behavior | OPEN | Implemented | [architecture](../architecture/python-release-asset-index.md) line 60 | `tests/` — 3 files, 26 tests passing | No |
| 21 | Resolve gh executable before subprocess invocation | OPEN | Still open | [gh-021 record](../issues/2026-07-19-gh-021-resolve-gh-executable.md) | `scripts/regen_index.py:80` still calls `subprocess.run(["gh", *args])` | No |

## Node IDs and digests

Issues #1–#15 have their node IDs and digests recorded in the
[rename sweep record](../issues/2026-07-19-gh-001-015-rename-sweep.md). The
remaining six:

| # | Node ID | Raw digest (SHA-256) |

Issues #16 through #21 were authored by ConcaveTrillion on 2026-05-22 and all
originate from the deep review and security scan report
`reports/security-review-2026-05-22/pd-index-pip.md`. None has a milestone.

## Deletion status

**No GitHub issue has been deleted.** The Deleted column above is `No` for every
row, and stays that way until the cutover gates in the
[migration runbook](../runbooks/github-issues-to-docgraph-migration.md) pass.

Two gates are still outstanding: organization-level issue deletion has not been
confirmed for the `pdomain` org, and this migration has not been pushed to the
remote default branch. Deletion is permanent and requires an explicit owner go.

When deletion proceeds, record each batch in an append-only deletion journal
alongside this ledger and update the Deleted column.
